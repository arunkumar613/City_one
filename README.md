# City One — AI-Powered City Pulse Platform  

**Hackathon Project by Team MR.Robots**  
_An intelligent real-time urban insight platform powered by AI and automation._

---

## Overview

City One is an AI-powered urban intelligence platform that provides citizens with a live, unified, and predictive view of their city.  
It aggregates data from traffic APIs, social media sentiment, EV hub status, and community reports to deliver actionable insights that enhance mobility, awareness, and civic engagement.

## Problem Statement

Urban data is vast yet fragmented—spread across sensors, social media, and civic platforms—making it difficult for citizens to act on.  
City One integrates and filters this data through AI-based clustering and NLP, presenting real-time, reliable, and predictive insights in one interactive dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Insights:** Visualizes congestion using live data and provides chatbot explanations for anomalies.  
- **City Sentiment Analysis:** Fetches social media data via n8n, processes it with Gemini AI, and displays sentiment heatmaps.  
- **EV Hub Monitoring:** Shows live EV charging station statuses across India.  
- **AI Chatbot (CityPulse AI):** Answers user queries using n8n Webhooks and Gemini AI.  
- **Community Help Reports:** Enables users to raise local issues, automatically acknowledged via AI-generated messages.
