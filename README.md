# City One â€” AI-Powered City Pulse Platform  

**Hackathon Project by Team MR.Robots**  
_An intelligent real-time urban insight platform powered by AI and automation._

---

## Overview

City One is an AI-driven urban intelligence platform that provides citizens with a live, actionable, and predictive view of their city.  
It integrates data from multiple real-time sources such as traffic APIs, social media sentiment, EV hub status, and community reports to present unified insights that improve navigation, decision-making, and civic engagement.

## Problem Statement

Modern cities generate massive amounts of data from sensors, social media, and citizen inputs, but this information is fragmented, redundant, and often difficult to interpret.  
City One solves this by unifying data from diverse sources, reducing noise through clustering and NLP, and providing a single platform for real-time, predictive urban insights.
